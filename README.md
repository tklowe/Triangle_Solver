# Triangle Solver
## Description
The Triangle Solver is a Python program that allows you to calculate missing sides and angles of a triangle using trigonometric formulas, such as the Law of Sines. This program can be helpful for solving various geometry and trigonometry problems related to triangles.
## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the Triangle Solver:
Enter known values for the triangle (side lengths and angles in degrees):
Side A: 5
Side B: 4
Side C: 0
Angle A: 30
Angle B: 0
Angle C: 60
Solved Triangle:
Side A: 5.0
Side B: 4.0
Side C: 6.0
Angle A: 30.0 degrees
Angle B: 60.0 degrees
Angle C: 90.0 degrees
